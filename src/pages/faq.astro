        q: "Do I need a bot, a Mini App, or both?",
        a: "It depends on your goals. A bot is great for simple commands, notifications, and automation. A Mini App provides a full web-like interface for complex tasks like e-commerce, dashboards, or games. Often, a combination of both offers the best user experience."
    },
    {
        q: "How long does it take to build a Mini App?",
        a: "A simple Mini App can take 2-4 weeks, while more complex applications with custom backends and payment integrations can take 2-3 months. We provide a detailed timeline after our initial discovery call."
    },
    {
        q: "What are the costs involved?",
        a: "Costs vary based on complexity. Our pricing tiers give a general idea, but we provide a custom quote for every project. Factors include design complexity, backend requirements, and third-party integrations."
    },
    {
        q: "Can you integrate with my existing systems?",
        a: "Absolutely. We can connect your Telegram Mini App to your existing CRM, e-commerce platform (like Shopify), or any other system with an API. This ensures a seamless flow of data for your business."
    },
    {
        q: "What happens after the project is launched?",
        a: "We offer ongoing support and maintenance packages to ensure your app runs smoothly, stays up-to-date with Telegram's platform changes, and continues to meet your business needs. We're your long-term partner for success."
